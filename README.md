## Overview
Latice is a Java-based application that showcases a board game with interactive elements. The project is structured to demonstrate various aspects of Java programming, including object-oriented design, GUI development with JavaFX, and handling game logic.

## Key Components
- **Game Logic**: Core game functionalities are implemented in Java, focusing on the rules and mechanics of the board game.
  - [`Game.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/application/Game.java)
- **Graphical User Interface**: The project uses JavaFX for its GUI, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.
  - [`BoardFX.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/ihm/view/BoardFX.java)
  - [`MenuFX.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/ihm/view/MenuFX.java)
  - [`PlayFX.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/ihm/view/PlayFX.java)
- **Controllers**: Various controllers handle different aspects of the game, such as drag-and-drop functionality, game parameters, and player actions.
  - [`DnDController.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/ihm/controller/DnDController.java)
  - [`ParametersController.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/ihm/controller/ParametersController.java)
- **Model**: The model part of the application includes the representation of the board, players, and tiles.
  - [`Player.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/model/Player.java)
  - [`Board.java`](https://github.com/paul-rezzonico/latice/blob/main/src/main/java/latice/model/board/Board.java)
